# Week Nine Project

## Project - Build a social network

**Link to project:** [Link]()

Continuing with Next.js and adding user authentication with the magic that is Clerk, we build a rudimentary 'social network' this week.

I chose to use Supabase for database hosting, with the site hosted on Vercel.

I kept track of my ideas, planning and progress here: [Planning](https://frankjs.notion.site/Day-Thirty-Nine-Project-24d3bd4839434c17bba360ad24613769?pvs=4)

### Requirements & Deliverables

- Use Clerk.com to set up user signup and login.

- Use the Clerk userId to associate posts with a user.

- Enable each user to create a profile associated with their userId, and a form to input their biography and location data, etc. with a URL similar to /user/[userId].

- Enable users to create posts associated with the userId, and display those posts on the user's profile page

- Show a 404 error if a user profile doesn't exist

- Use at least 1 Radix UI Primitive or similar

**Stretch Goals**

- Enable users to visit other user profiles after seeing their posts on a global timeline

- Enable users to follow other users by creating a follower and follwee relationship between two user profiles

- Enable users to like other users' posts by creating a user_id and liked_post relationship in a junction table

- A user's biography cannot be blank. If a user logs in but doesn't have a biography set, they should be asked to fill one in

### User Stories

- As a user, I am able to sign up for an account and create a user profile
- As a user, I am able to log in and out of my account
- As a user, I am able to create posts on my profile timeline
- As a user, I am able to see all posts by all users on a global timeline

### Stretch Stories

- As a user, I am able to see a list of other user's posts and/or profiles on the site
- As a user, I am able able to visit other user profiles
- As a user, I am able to follow other users
- As a user, I am able to like posts I think are good, and see how many likes a post has
